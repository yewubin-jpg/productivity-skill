This is an AI agent skill for platforms like OpenClaw, designed to help users master their time, energy, and focus. It's not just another to-do list app; it's a complete system for peak performance built on 15 years of research and practice with millions of users.

## Quick Reference

| Situation | Method | Action |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Feeling overwhelmed | Energy Assessment (L1-L4) | Assess energy level first |
| Procrastinating | ABC255 Method | Do A, Defer B, Record C |
| Too many goals | Waterdrop 520 | Write 25 → Select 5 → Eliminate 20 |
| Can't plan the day | Five-Color Day | Design day with 5 color blocks |
| Big project stuck | PNAS Decomposition | Picture → Nouns → Actions → Sequence |
| Need decision help | 3Q4D Framework | 3 Questions + 4D Actions |
| Want life direction | Three-Circle Intersection | Joy + Strength + Meaning |
| Building habits | 90-Day Sprint | Coach-led practice system |
| Long-term growth | Nine-Level System | 9 mastery levels |

## Core Philosophy: Energy is Everything

Time isn't your problem. Energy is. This skill is built on a simple but powerful idea: **Do the most important things in your best energy state.**

We call this the **16x Productivity Principle**: 2 hours of deep, focused work during your peak energy window can lead to a 16x improvement in productivity.

## What's Inside?

This skill encapsulates the entire YiXiaoNeng (易效能) system, including:

*   **The Nine-Level Performance System**: A step-by-step guide from single-task focus to life mastery.
*   **ABC255 Work Method**: A ruthless prioritization and execution framework (Do A, Defer B, Record C).
*   **PNAS Project Decomposition**: A method to break down any goal into actionable steps (Picture → Nouns → Actions → Sequence).
*   **Waterdrop 520 Goal Method**: A system to focus on the 5 most critical goals and eliminate the rest.
*   **3Q4D Decision Framework**: 3 Questions (Should I? What result? First step?) + 4D Actions (Delete, Delay, Delegate, Do).
*   **Energy-First Approach**: Manage your physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual energy to sustain high performance.
