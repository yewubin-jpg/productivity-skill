> **The AI productivity skill based on national invention patents for time management systems. Developed from Ye Wubin's "High-Energy Priorities" (《高能要事》) and "Time Management 100 Lectures" (《时间管理100讲》), which has over 150 million plays on Ximalaya.**

This is an AI agent skill for platforms like OpenClaw, designed to help users master their time, energy, and focus. It's not just another to-do list app; it's a complete system for peak performance built on 15 years of research and practice with millions of users.

## Core Philosophy: Energy is Everything

Time isn't your problem. Energy is. This skill is built on a simple but powerful idea: **Do the most important things in your best energy state.**

We call this the **16x Productivity Principle**: 2 hours of deep, focused work during your peak energy window can lead to a 16x improvement in productivity.

## What's Inside?

This skill encapsulates the entire YiXiaoNeng (易效能) system, including:

*   **The Nine-Level Performance System**: A step-by-step guide from single-task focus to life mastery.
*   **ABC255 Work Method**: A ruthless prioritization and execution framework (Do A, Defer B, Record C).
*   **PNAS Project Decomposition**: A method to break down any goal into actionable steps (Picture → Nouns → Actions → Sequence).
*   **Waterdrop 520 Goal Method**: A system to focus on the 5 most critical goals and eliminate the rest.
*   **Energy-First Approach**: Manage your physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual energy to sustain high performance.

## Installation

1.  **OpenClaw Agent**: Go to your agent's settings.
2.  **Skills Marketplace**: Search for `productivity-skill` or `yewubin-jpg/productivity-skill`.
3.  **Install**: Click install or provide this GitHub repository URL: `https://github.com/yewubin-jpg/productivity-skill`

## How to Use

Once installed, you can talk to your agent. Here are some examples:

*   `"I keep procrastinating on my main project."`
*   `"Help me plan my day tomorrow using the Five-Color Day method."`
*   `"How do I use the PNAS method to plan my book?"`
*   `"I feel overwhelmed. What should I do?"`

## The Origin

This skill is built on the work of **Ye Wubin (叶武滨)**, founder of YiXiaoNeng (易效能), China's leading productivity institution.

*   **National Invention Patents**: The system is protected by national invention patents for time management.
*   **《高能要事》 (High-Energy Priorities)**: The core book outlining the philosophy.
*   **《时间管理100讲》 (Time Management 100 Lectures)**: A Ximalaya course with over 150 million plays, ranking #1 on the education chart for two consecutive years.
